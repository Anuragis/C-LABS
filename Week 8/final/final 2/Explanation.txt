Used reserve_size() function before calling prepend and insertion.
This reduces the unnecessay call to copy constructor and thus reduces the overhead.

Graph nature

For Prepend
Vector: Increases exponentially as per size
List: Remains constant

For Append
Vector: Increases linearly as per size
List: Slowly increases linearly 

For Get
Vector: Remains constant
List: Increases exponentially as per size

For Remove
Vector: Increases exponentially as per size
List: Increases exponentially as per size

For Insert
Vector: Increases Linearly as per size
List: Increases Linearly as per size
